# Mobile_Robot_PIDValue_Wall_Following
This is a second assignment of Mobile Robot when i study at De Montfort University 2021-2022, I hope you find it useful.

We implemented by using vscode, it bases on Python to control simulator in CoppeliaSim (V-REP). 
The mission of assignment is randomly the robot and detect the wall after then the robot will run nearly the wall. 

** Previous assignment when the robot turn left or right, we used static values, it always follows the condition of if-else coding that the robot cannot approximate the speed of wheel such a how to use the speed of left wheel and right wheel, So the robot does not run as straight as it should. **   

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are increased the level of robot to control from PID controller that fix the problem of previous problem. It will give efficiency to calculate control the speed of wheel when the robot curves.

The achievement is how to control the speed of robot, turn left or right by PID controller, how to use ultrasonic sensors.
